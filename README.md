Its a Data Analytics Project on NBA Draft Combine Measurements where I have done-
1. Data Collection: Gather NBA Draft Combine measurement data.
2. Data Cleaning: Clean the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
3. Analysis: Use data analytics tools (like Python, R, or Excel) to:
   - Identify trends and patterns in player measurements.
   - Analyze correlations between measurements and player performance.
4. Visualization: Create visual reports to present your findings.
